    <p>Functional components are the more straightforward of the two types. They are implemented as JavaScript functions that return JSX (JavaScript XML), which is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like structures within JavaScript. These components can receive props (properties) as arguments, facilitating dynamic rendering based on the provided data.
Key Features:
Stateless: Typically, functional components do not manage their own state, which makes them simpler to understand and test.
Conciseness: They offer a more streamlined syntax compared to class components.
Hooks: Since the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, functional components can now handle state and side effects, enabling them to perform many functions that were once exclusive to class components.
